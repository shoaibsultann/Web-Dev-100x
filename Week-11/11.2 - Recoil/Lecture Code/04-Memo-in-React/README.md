# Easy Explanation

The `memo` function in React helps optimize the rendering of functional components by avoiding unnecessary updates. It works by **memorizing** the last rendered output of a component and only re-rendering it if its props change.

### What Problem Does `memo` Solve?

Imagine you have a functional component that re-renders every time its parent component updates, even if its props haven't changed. This can waste processing power and slow down your app. 

By wrapping the component in `memo`, React checks if the props are the same as the last render:
- **If the props haven't changed:** React skips rendering the component.
- **If the props have changed:** The component is re-rendered.

### How Does `memo` Work?

1. **Default Behavior:** 
   `memo` performs a **shallow comparison** of the props. If all the props are the same (primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans), the component is not re-rendered.

2. **Custom Behavior:**
   You can provide a custom function to decide when the component should re-render (useful for complex props like objects or arrays).

### Example

#### Without `memo`:
```javascript
function Greeting({ name }) {
  console.log("Rendering Greeting");
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

// If the parent re-renders, Greeting will re-render even if `name` hasnâ€™t changed.
```

#### With `memo`:
```javascript
import React, { memo } from "react";

const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ name }) {
  console.log("Rendering Greeting");
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
});

// Now, Greeting will only re-render if the `name` prop changes.
```

### Custom Comparison Function

By default, `memo` uses shallow comparison. If you want more control, you can pass a second argumentâ€”a function to compare `prevProps` and `nextProps`:

```javascript
const Greeting = memo(function Greeting({ user }) {
  console.log("Rendering Greeting");
  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;
}, (prevProps, nextProps) => {
  return prevProps.user.name === nextProps.user.name;
});
```

### When to Use `memo`

- Use `memo` for components that:
  - Receive the same props frequently.
  - Are expensive to render (e.g., complex calculations or heavy UI).

- Avoid using `memo` if:
  - The component is small or renders quickly.
  - Props are constantly changing, as `memo` adds a slight overhead.
