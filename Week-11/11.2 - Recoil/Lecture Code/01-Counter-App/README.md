# Easy Explanation of this APP.

This code implements a simple React application to manage and display a counter value. However, it is labeled as **"bad code"** because it doesn't use the most efficient or clean design practices. Let’s go through the code step by step:

---

### **How the Code Works**

#### 1. **`App` Component**

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Counter />
    </>
  );
}
```

- **Purpose**: This is the root component that renders the `Counter` component.
- The empty `<>...</>` tags are a shorthand for a React fragment, which is used to group children components without adding an extra DOM node.

---

#### 2. **`Counter` Component**

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <CurrentCount count={count} />
      <Increase setCount={setCount} />
      <Decrease setCount={setCount} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Purpose**: Manages the state of the counter using the `useState` hook.
- **State Management**: 
  - `useState(0)` initializes `count` to `0` and provides a function `setCount` to update the state.
- **Child Components**:
  - `CurrentCount`: Displays the current `count` value.
  - `Increase`: Provides a button to increment the `count`.
  - `Decrease`: Provides a button to decrement the `count`.

---

#### 3. **`CurrentCount` Component**

```jsx
function CurrentCount({ count }) {
  return <div>{count}</div>;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Displays the current counter value.
- **Props**:
  - Receives `count` as a prop and renders it.

---

#### 4. **`Increase` Component**

```jsx
function Increase({ setCount }) {
  function increase() {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={increase}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a button to increase the counter value.
- **Logic**:
  - The `setCount` function is passed as a prop.
  - Clicking the button calls `increase()`, which uses the `setCount` function to increment the counter.

---

#### 5. **`Decrease` Component**

```jsx
function Decrease({ setCount }) {
  function decrease() {
    setCount(c => c - 1);
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={decrease}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a button to decrease the counter value.
- **Logic**:
  - Works similarly to the `Increase` component but decrements the counter instead.

---

### **Why Is It "Bad Code"?**

1. **Prop Drilling**:
   - The `setCount` function is passed down as props from `Counter` to both `Increase` and `Decrease`. This is called **prop drilling**, which can become unmanageable as the app grows and the state needs to be shared with deeper components.

2. **Redundant Component Design**:
   - Both `Increase` and `Decrease` components are highly similar, differing only in the operation (increment vs decrement). This could be combined into a single component with a prop like `type` to determine the action.

3. **Tightly Coupled Components**:
   - The logic for state updates is embedded in individual components (`Increase` and `Decrease`), making them less reusable.

4. **Over-Fragmentation**:
   - Splitting logic into many small components (`Increase`, `Decrease`, `CurrentCount`) might seem clean but can lead to unnecessary complexity for such a simple task.

---

### **Better Design Using Context API**

Using the **Context API** (like in your first example) avoids prop drilling by sharing the `count` and `setCount` directly with any child components. This improves scalability and reduces code redundancy. 

---

### **Final Remarks**
While this code works, it’s not ideal for large or scalable applications. Use **Context API** or state management libraries (like Redux or Zustand) for better structure when managing shared states across components.
